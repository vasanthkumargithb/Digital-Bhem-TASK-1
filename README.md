📰 Combating Fake News with Data Science 🔍

I'm thrilled to share my recent work on Fake News Detection, leveraging data science to address one of the most pressing challenges of the digital age.

Here’s how I approached this task:
📂 Dataset Selection: Utilized datasets like Kaggle’s Fake News Detection Dataset, PolitiFact’s Liar Dataset, and BuzzFeedNews' collection.
🛠️ Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and preprocessed text data by removing stopwords, stemming, and vectorizing.
✨ Feature Engineering: Extracted critical features, including TF-IDF, word embeddings, and sentiment analysis.
🤖 Model Building: Developed machine learning and deep learning models such as LSTM and BERT for robust classification.
📊 Evaluation: Assessed model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

This project highlights how innovative tools and techniques can help mitigate misinformation and build a more informed society. Looking forward to applying these insights to real-world applications!
